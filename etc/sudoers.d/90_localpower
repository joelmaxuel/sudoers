# Allow specific users (of `sudo` group) to poweroff; reboot; suspend
# Does not require a password


## User alias specification

User_Alias	LOCALPOWER = %sudo

## Cmnd alias specification

Cmnd_Alias	SHUTDOWN = \
		    /sbin/poweroff, \
		    /sbin/reboot, \
                    /sbin/shutdown, \
		    /bin/systemctl suspend
# A few ways for the given user to change the power state

## Modifications to behaviour

Defaults!SHUTDOWN	!authenticate,!runaspw,runas_default=root
# Don't require a password for these commands
# Also override the pass-through account

## All together now
