# Allow specific users (line twelve below) rights to complete tasks
# Requires a password, but not their own nor our most privileged user
# Can also define more fine-tuned user aliases in `30_usergroups`

# NEVER allow an unrestrained editor or file management tool as part 
# of the config!  Ideally don't have them at all to avoid loopholes.
# ALSO: better to clear any specification not used on a regular basis


## User alias specification

User_Alias	SYSTEMTASK = %dumb
# These are your users who will be given access.  Better to explicity
# define the users instead of populating a system group (some members
# may have group manager rights, ready to exploit that fact).  Even
# better (if assigning several people) to use the `30_usergroups` file.

# Runas alias specification

Runas_Alias	SUBSTITUTE = root
# These are the users you intend to impersonate.  Given the current
# setup, you will need to specify which in each command (sudo -u ...)

## Cmnd alias specification

Cmnd_Alias	EMERGSHUT = \
		    /sbin/reboot, \
		    /sbin/shutdown
# System shutdown/reboot for emergency cases
# Do not use on a firewall box; theoretically can expose your other PC's

Cmnd_Alias	USRGPMGMT = \
		    /usr/sbin/adduser, \
		    /usr/sbin/addgroup, \
		    /usr/sbin/deluser, \
		    /usr/sbin/delgroup, \
		    /usr/sbin/useradd, \
		    /usr/sbin/userdel, \
		    /usr/sbin/usermod, \
		    /usr/sbin/groupadd, \
		    /usr/sbin/groupdel, \
		    /usr/sbin/groupmod
# Some user and group management tools if you admin for many people
# Attacker can add and (relatively) escalate their own accounts as well

Cmnd_Alias	USERRESET = \
		    /usr/local/bin/regpasswd
# Changes passwords, locks/unlocks, et cetera for "regular" accounts
# Shim for a risky (by itself) binary - mitigated, not necessarily safe

Cmnd_Alias	DRIVEMGMT = \
		    /bin/mount, \
		    /bin/umount, \
		    /usr/sbin/gparted
# Basic tools (e.g. for a home user) to manage removable media
# Threat for use in a remote attack appears to land on mischief-level

Cmnd_Alias	STARTSTOP = \
		    /usr/sbin/service, \
		    /bin/journalctl, \
		    /bin/kill, \
		    /usr/bin/killall, \
		    /bin/dmesg
# Changes status of processes not belonging to user; read debugging
# Better to limit the list (specify exact intent) if used at all, since
# this can easily be used to expose more threats (incl with PAKAGMGMT).

Cmnd_Alias	PAKAGMGMT = \
		    /usr/bin/apt, \
		    /usr/bin/dpkg, \
		    sudoedit /etc/apt/sources.list
# Some package management for Debian (based) systems
# Not reasonable for most environments as attacker can package payload

Cmnd_Alias	HTTPTOOLS = \
		    /usr/sbin/a2query, \
		    /usr/sbin/a2ensite, \
		    /usr/sbin/a2enmod, \
		    /usr/sbin/a2dissite
# Tools for managing Apache2 (sample; edit to what works for you)
# "Unwanted" modules and newly-redirected sites (for example) can be
# a concern if Apache config directories are not properly secured.

Cmnd_Alias	BINDTOOLS = \
		    /usr/sbin/named-checkconf, \
		    /usr/sbin/named-checkzone
# Verify changes and general stability of your DNS.  Risk of attack
# depends on your responsibililty of zone file security, for example.

Cmnd_Alias	MAILTOOLS = \
		    /usr/bin/mailq, \
		    /usr/bin/newaliases
# Basic tools for maintaining your mail transport agent. Also (in the
# case of `newaliases`) assumes accessibility to `aliases` file.  If
# they are compromised, you'll lose future sudo alerts.  Protect them.

Cmnd_Alias	CONTAINER = \
		    /usr/bin/lxc-start, \
		    /usr/bin/lxc-stop, \
		    /usr/bin/lxc-info, \
		    /usr/bin/lxc-snapshot, \
		    /usr/bin/lxc-monitor
# Some stuff related to LXC.  Left out `lxc-attach` as by itself *will*
# allow an attacker god access in any container, and the ability to get
# back to bare metal.  If you need regular access, seek an alternative.
